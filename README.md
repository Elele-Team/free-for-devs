# Free for Developers

This is a full list of services, software and tools that are available for developers. There are already existing lists available, that are comprehensive and include majority of those listed here. However, we felt that we could update ours more often. 

> The scope of this particular list is limited to things infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.
